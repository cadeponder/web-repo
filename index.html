  <p>I am from Austin Texas, and have just recently transferred within engineering
  to the CTD major. I have been having a lot of fun so far, and can't wait to further expand
  my skillset while having fun. Outside of school I have always enjoyed doing mixed media art,
  hanging out with friends outside, and long car rides. Click this button for my art work in progress instagram account! <button id="insta">WIP's</button></p>
